# MHASH ※ Monster Hunter Armor Set Helper

❗ **VERY WIP!** Tools to extract game date and plan sets for Monster Hunter games.

😶‍🌫️ Yes, it is weird to start such a project a few days before the Wilds release, I know.
But I wanted a project to tinker around stuff and this was my best idea.

➡️ Do not have any expectations of a finished app in the near future.

## mhash-extract

For now just working on the data extraction part and normalizing it.

- WorldBorne: **very WIP**
- RiseBreak: *not sure*
- Wilds: *only after I beat the game*

## mhash-app

*__Not started:__ Will be a static web app using the extracted data.*
